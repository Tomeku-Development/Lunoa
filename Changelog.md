## Aptos Smart Contract: Core Quest Logic

This update marks a major milestone with the successful development and testing of the foundational `LunoaQuests` smart contract on the Aptos blockchain. The contract now supports the complete, basic lifecycle of a quest.

-   **Contract Implementation (`quests.move`)**: 
    -   Developed the core Move module with `Quest` and `QuestStore` structs to manage all on-chain quest data.
    -   Implemented three key entry functions: `create_quest`, `join_quest`, and `complete_quest`.
    -   Set up event handles for `QuestCreated`, `QuestJoined`, and `QuestCompleted` to enable off-chain services to listen to contract activity.

-   **Comprehensive Unit Testing (`quests_tests.move`)**:
    -   Built a robust test suite covering the entire quest lifecycle: creation, joining, and completion.
    -   Resolved multiple complex Move testing errors, including resource initialization, private function access, and correct test account setup.
    -   Implemented a test-only `view` function to allow tests to assert against the contract's internal state, ensuring logic correctness.

-   **Build & Configuration**:
    -   Configured the `Move.toml` manifest with the necessary dependencies and named addresses for successful compilation and testing.

This update focuses on stabilizing the backend testing suite, fixing critical bugs in the quest and user controllers, and improving the reliability of the Aptos blockchain integration.

## Features & Fixes

-   **Quest Verification (`verifyQuestCompletion`)**:
    -   Successfully implemented a robust Jest test suite for the `verifyQuestCompletion` endpoint.
    -   Fixed all previously failing tests by correcting middleware mocking, resolving test timeouts, and preventing state leakage between tests.
    -   Refactored the controller to use the dynamic `reward_amount` from the quest details instead of a hardcoded value.
    -   Added comprehensive test coverage for success, error (403 Forbidden), and edge cases (e.g., participant status not 'submitted', user has no Aptos address).

-   **User Controller (`users.controller.ts`)**:
    -   Fixed a critical bug in the `getUserActivity` function where `userId` was used without being defined, causing runtime errors.

-   **Project Management**:
    -   Updated `Backend-Todolist.md` to accurately reflect the completion of the quest verification testing tasks.

## Technical Improvements

-   **Testing Framework**: Stabilized the Jest and Supertest environment by correcting the implementation and isolation of mocked middleware (`protect`).
-   **Code Quality**: Cleaned up redundant code in `users.controller.ts` and improved type safety in test files.
